The ghost indicates that something fundamental is wrong in Denmark. It's as if King 
Hamlet's death has upset the balance of nature, and so his shadow is enlarged in this 
unholy way that bridges this world and the next.

Horatio is more of a rationalist when he sees the ghost. J. Dover Wilson writes that the people who see the ghost represent
differing points of view concerning apparitions expressed in theological
controversies of the time: Marcellus and Barnardo exhibit the traditional Catholic
view expounded by Pierre Le Loyer (1586) that a sould might come to earth from
purgatory; Horatio displays the skeptical attitude of Reginald Scot (1584), who
denies that spirits can assume material form and thereby appear to men.
