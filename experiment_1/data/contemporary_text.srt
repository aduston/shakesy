1
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,282
1:Who's there?

2
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:44,133
2:No, who are you? Stop and identify yourself.

3
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,854
1:Long live the king!

4
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:46,817
2:Is that Barnardo?

5
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,170
1:Yes, it's me.

6
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,646
2:You've arrived right on time.

7
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:54,150
1:The clock just struck twelve. Go to bed, Francisco.

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,705
2:Thanks for relieving me. It's bitterly cold, and I'm saddened.

9
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:05,183
1:Has anything happened during your guard?

10
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:07,567
2:Not a mouse stirring.

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,101
1:Well, good night.

12
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,351
2:Stop! Who's there?

13
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,964
3:Friends to this country. And servants to the Danish king.

14
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,173
2:Good night to you both.

15
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:19,703
1:Farewell, honest soldier. Who has relieved you?

16
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:24,029
3:Barnardo took my place. Good night.

17
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:29,202
4:Hello, Barnardo.

18
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:32,651
1:Hello. Is Horatio here too?

19
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,499
3:Kind of.

20
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:38,801
1:Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

21
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,117
3:Did you see that thing again tonight?

22
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:44,016
1:I have seen nothing.

23
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:51,683
4:Horatio says it's our imagination, and he won't believe in the horrible thing we've seen twice now.

24
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:56,567
4:That's why I begged him to come on our shift tonight

25
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:02,983
4:So that if the ghost comes, he can see what we see and speak to it.

26
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,466
3:Nonsense, it won't appear.

27
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:11,700
1:Then let us tell you again the story you don't want to believe, about what we've seen two nights now.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,716
3:Well, let's hear Barnardo talk about this.

29
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:19,700
1:Last night, when that star to the west of the North star

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,958
1:Had traveled across the sky to light up that part of heaven where it shines now, Marcellus and I, at one o'clock a.m.--

31
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,202
4:Look, it's come again!

32
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:35,233
1:Looking just like the dead king.

33
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,980
4:You're well-educated. Speak to it, Horatio.

34
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,205
1:Doesn't it look like the king, Horatio?

35
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:43,582
3:Very much so. It terrifies me.

36
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,933
1:It wants us to speak to it. Ask it something, Horatio.

37
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:52,400
3:What are you, that you walk out so late at night looking like you're dressed for battle

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,183
3:In the same way the dead king of Denmark when he dressed for battle? By God, I order you to speak.

39
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,333
4:It is offended. Look, it's going away.

40
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,230
3:Stay! Speak, speak! I order you, speak!

41
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:09,025
4:It's gone and will not answer.

42
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:14,933
3:I swear to God, I would not believe this if I had not seen it with my own eyes.

43
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:20,933
4:It's happened like this twice before, always at this exact time. He goes by our post with a warrior's walk.

44
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:28,416
3:I don't really know how to explain this, but I have the general feeling this means bad news for our country.

45
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:40,618
4:Alright, come close and somebody tell me why this strict schedule of guards has been employed.

46
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:46,734
4:And why so many bronze cannons are being manufactured, and so many weapons bought from abroad.

47
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:53,800
4:Is there something about to happen that makes it necessary to work night and day?

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,721
4:Who can explain this to me?

49
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:03,952
3:I can. At least, these are the rumors: our late king,

50
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:10,967
3:Who we just saw now as a ghost, was a great rival or Fortinbras of Norway.

51
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:19,401
3:Fortinbras dared him to battle. In that fight, our courageous Hamlet killed Fortinbras, who surrendered all his territories, along with his life.

52
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:24,284
3:But now old Fortinbras' young son, also called Fortinbras, who is bold but unproven,

53
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:28,633
3:Has gathered up a bunch of lawless thugs from the outskirts of the country.

54
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:34,533
3:They're supposed to recover from us the the lands I mentioned that old Fortinbras lost. And this, I take it,

55
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:40,500
3:Is the main reason for our preparations, the reason for our posted here, and the chief reason

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,951
3:For the commotion in Denmark lately.

57
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:49,584
3:Wait, look! It has come again. I'll cross it if it's the last thing I do. Stay, ghost!

58
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,966
3:If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.

59
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:55,925
3:If you have some secret knowledge of our country's fate, which could be avoided if we knew about it, then please speak.

60
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:59,114
0:(cock crowing)

61
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,966
3:Stay and speak!

62
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,066
3:Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.

63
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,417
4:Should I strike it with my spear?

64
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,653
1:It's over here.

65
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,744
3:There it is.

66
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:20,667
4:It's gone. We were wrong to threaten it with violence, since it looks so much like a king.

67
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:30,166
4:Besides, we can't hurt it anymore than we can hurt the air. Our futile attack was just malicious mockery.

68
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,500
1:It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,799
3:And then it acted startled, like a guilty person receiving a fearful summons.

70
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:42,396
4:Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed. Some say that just before Christmas

71
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:49,952
4:the rooster crows all night long

72
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:58,917
4:so that no ghost dares go wandering, and the night is safe. The planets have no effect on us,

73
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:07,316
4:fairies' spells don't work, and witches can't charm us, so holy that night is.

74
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:12,134
3:I've heard the same thing and kind of believe it.

75
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:21,400
3:But look, morning is appearing beyond that hill in the east, turning the sky red.

76
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:34,617
3:Let's stop our watch and go tell everything we've seen tonight

77
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:46,368
3:to young Hamlet. I bet my life that the ghost which is mute with us will speak to him.
