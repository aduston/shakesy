1
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,282
1:Who's there?

2
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:44,133
2:Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.

3
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,854
1:Long live the king!

4
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:46,817
2:Barnardo?

5
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,170
1:He.

6
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,646
2:You come most carefully upon your hour.

7
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:54,150
1:'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,705
2:For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.

9
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:05,183
1:Have you had quiet guard?

10
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:07,567
2:Not a mouse stirring.

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,101
1:Well, good night.

12
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,351
2:Stand, ho! Who's there?

13
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,964
3:Friends to this ground. And liegemen to the Dane.

14
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,173
2:Give you good night.

15
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:19,703
4:Farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved you?

16
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:24,029
2:Barnardo has my place. Give you good night.

17
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:29,202
4:Holla, Barnardo.

18
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:32,651
1:Say what, is Horatio there?

19
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,499
3:A piece of him.

20
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:38,801
1:Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.

21
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,117
3:What, has this thing appeared again tonight?

22
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:44,016
1:I have seen nothing.

23
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:51,683
4:Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.

24
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:56,567
4:Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night,

25
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:02,983
4:That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

26
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,466
3:Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

27
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:11,700
1:Then let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we have two nights seen.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,716
3:Well, let us hear Barnardo speak of this.

29
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:19,700
1:Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,958
1:Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Where it now burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating once--

31
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,202
4:Look where it comes again!

32
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:35,233
1:In the same figure like the king that's dead.

33
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,980
4:Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.

34
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,205
1:Looks it not like the king? Mark it, Horatio.

35
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:43,582
3:Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.

36
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,933
1:It would be spoke to.
Question it, Horatio.

37
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:52,400
3:What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Together with that fair and warlike form

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,183
3:In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,
speak.

39
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,333
4:It is offended.
See, it stalks away.

40
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,230
3:Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

41
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:09,025
4:'Tis gone and will not answer.

42
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:14,933
3:Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

43
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:20,933
4:Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

44
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:28,416
3:In what particular thought to work I know not,
But in the gross and scope of mine opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

45
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:40,618
4:Good now, stand close, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,

46
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:46,734
4:And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war,

47
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:53,800
4:What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,721
4:Who is 't that can inform me?

49
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:03,952
3:That can I.
At least the whisper goes so: our last king,

50
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:10,967
3:Whose image even but now appeared to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,

51
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:19,401
3:Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Did slay this Fortinbras, who thus
Did forfeit, with his life, all these his lands.

52
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:24,284
3:Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,

53
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:28,633
3:Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes,

54
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:34,533
3:To recover of us, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost. And this, I take it,

55
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:40,500
3:Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch, and the chief head

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,951
3:Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.

57
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:49,584
3:But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again.
I'll cross it though it blast me. Stay, illusion!

58
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,966
3:If thou hast any sound or use of voice,
Speak to me.

59
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:55,925
3:If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
Oh, speak!

60
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:59,114
0:(cock crowing)

61
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,966
3:Stay and speak!

62
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,066
3:Stop it, Marcellus.

63
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,417
4:Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

64
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,653
1:'Tis here.

65
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,744
3:'Tis here.

66
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:20,667
4:'Tis gone.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence,

67
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:30,166
4:For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

68
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,500
1:It was about to speak when the cock crew.

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,799
3:And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons.

70
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:42,396
3:It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes

71
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:49,952
3:Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long.

72
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:58,917
4:And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad.
The nights are wholesome. Then no planets strike,

73
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:07,316
4:No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallowed and so gracious is that time.

74
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:12,134
3:So have I heard and do in part believe it.

75
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:21,400
3:But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.

76
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:34,617
3:Break we our watch up, and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen tonight

77
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:46,368
3:Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
